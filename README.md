# MeetUps!
My first app to get to know Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

## Core features
* User Accounts: Create accounts, log in, and log out of the app.

* Create Meetups: Organizers can organize new meetups, providing titles, descriptions, locations, and date/time information.

* Edit/Cancel Meetups: Organizers have the possibility to edit or cancel meetups and view registered participants.

* Join and Leave Meetups: Participants may register for the meetups and easily deregister.

* Both participants and organizers can use the "My meetups" section to:

   * Participants – see meetups they are registered for.
   * Organizers – see meetups they are organizing.
